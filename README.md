## Version 2.0 (Cat Model)

For this test, I downloaded the cat model from the Unity Store. And built a script that can detect planes, whether horizontal or vertical. When the user clicks on the plane, the cat model will appear. At the same time, the user can change the position of the cat by moving it.
